This project won't see further work.  There's no way I can create anything as functional as what already exists (in Kodi, Jellyfin, Fire TV, etc).
  
More importantly (for my continued happiness at home) there's a 0% chance it would ever be stable enough and nice enough to win Wife approval and acceptance ðŸ˜†
  
Was very educational though!

-----------------------

This project is meant to serve as a somewhat flexible HTPC frontend software for my family's needs.
If it works for you; that is great too!  Just don't expect it to be quite as flexible as XBMC, Media Portal, or other solutions out there.
